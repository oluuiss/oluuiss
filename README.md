I'm Luis Gustavo, a passionate software developer and tech enthusiast. I currently work as a Administrative Assistant at Okuma Citrus. However, I am open to new opportunities in the technology sector! Furthermore, I'am studying Computer Engineering at Unifev College, in Votuporanga - SP, Brazil.

### ðŸ“Œ Experience

I have already obtained certifications from the company ViaCerta in beginner training as a programmer in Java, Javascript, Object Oriented Programming, SQL Database and Web Development. 

I constantly seek to improve my knowledge and skills. I have the ability to solve problems, think critically, work in a team and have good communication. In the academic environment, I seek to improve myself in different programming languages, fundamental computing concepts and software development through projects and challenges.

In addition to graduation, I constantly seek to expand my knowledge through courses and individual projects. I am looking for opportunities in the job market in the area of â€‹â€‹Program Development, Mobile and Back-end.
